          I miss you, B. I miss having you close to me. Would say more but the
          site is public so ü§ê. You are always welcome. Also, overmorrow is my
          birthday, would make my day if you wish me a happy one. And I have a
          question.

        <p>
          Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it
          shall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he
          that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. Or
          what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him
          a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? If ye then,
          being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much
          more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them
          that ask him?
